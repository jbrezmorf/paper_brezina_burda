    abstract = {We introduce a discrete fracture network model of stationary Darcy flow in fractured rocks. We approximate the fractures by a network of planar circle disks, which is generated on the basis of statistical data obtained from field measurements. We then discretize this network into a mesh consisting of triangular elements placed in three-dimensional space. We use geometrical approximations in fracture planes, which allow for a significant simplification of the final triangular meshes. We consider two-dimensional Darcy flow in each fracture. In order to accurately simulate the channeling effect, we assign to each triangle an aperture defining its hydraulic permeability. For the discretization we use the lowest order {Raviart-Thomas} mixed finite element method. This method gives quite an accurate velocity field, which is computed directly and which satisfies the mass balance on each triangular element. We demonstrate the use of this method on a model problem with a known analytical solution and 
describe the generation and triangulation of the fracture network and the computation of fracture flow for a particular real situation.},

	url = {http://dml.cz/dmlcz/135798},
	abstract = {There are many problems of groundwater flow in a disrupted rock massifs that should be modelled using numerical models. It can be done via “standard approaches” such as increase of the permeability of the porous medium to account the fracture system (or double-porosity models), or discrete stochastic fracture network models. Both of these approaches appear to have their constraints and limitations, which make them unsuitable for the large- scale long-time hydrogeological calculations. In the article, a new approach to the modelling of groudwater flow in fractured porous medium, which combines the above-mentioned models, is described. This article presents the mathematical formulation and demonstration of numerical results obtained by this new approach. The approach considers three substantial types of objects within a structure of modelled massif important for the groudwater flow – small stochastic fractures, large deterministic fractures, and lines of intersection of the large fractures. The 
systems of stochastic fractures are represented by blocks of porous medium with suitably set hydraulic conductivity. The large fractures are represented as polygons placed in {3D} space and their intersections are represented by lines. Thus flow in {3D} porous medium, flow in {2D} and {1D} fracture systems, and communication among these three systems are modelled together.},
